# Guess-my-number

The game involves guessing a mysterious number from 1 to 20.

We lose a life with each attempt (we have 20 lives in total), if we give a number that is smaller than the number to be guessed, we will receive information about it. If the given number is too small, we will also receive information about it!

Highscore is the place for the best result obtained, in other words the lowest number of lives lost. If we guess the number 5 times, Highscore will display: 15! If we guess the number faster next time, e.g. the 2nd time, Highscore will display: 18!

To play again, just press the Again button!
